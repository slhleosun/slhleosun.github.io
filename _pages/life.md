## More on my academic journey 

Before focusing on LM research, I specialized in competition and applied mathematics. In 2020, I ranked 91st out of 20,800 participants worldwide in the American Mathematics Competition 12 and was invited to the American Olympiad selection. I also authored a paper on applied mathematical modeling for optimization in econometrics. 

I’ve been fortunate to receive nearly every undergraduate research award available at the UChicago, including the Quad Undergraduate Research Scholar Award (Winter & Summer 2024, $10,500), the Jeff Metcalf Grant (Winter & Fall 2023, $3,000), the Data Science Institute Summer Lab Grant (Summer 2023, $6,000), the Advanced Scholars Award (Winter 2025, $5,000), and the Cognitive Science Undergraduate Research Award (Winter 2024, $500).

## Startups

I am also actively working on startups. Currently, I’m building Annotaverse, a gamified, crowdsourced AI data annotation platform, as part of [Beta University](https://www.betauniversity.org/) Pre-Accelerator Cohort 6. Another endeavor involved creating AI models that generate personalized ASMR soundtracks, operated within the UChicago-based [International Leadership Council](https://ilc.uchicago.edu/) incubator. 

## Music

I’m deeply interested in indie music and its surrounding subcultures, and I frequently attend live shows. My favorite bands and artists include 脏手指 (Oh! Dirty Fingers), My Bloody Valentine, and ミドリ (Midori). I’ve also written for a music magazine in the past - you can find my pieces here:
