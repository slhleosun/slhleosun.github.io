### More on my academic journey 

Before focusing on LM research, I specialized in competition math. In 2020, I ranked 91st out of 20,800 participants worldwide in the American Mathematics Competition 12 and was invited to the American Olympiad selection. I also authored a paper on applied mathematical modeling for optimization in econometrics. 

<!-- I’ve been fortunate to receive nearly every undergraduate research award available at the UChicago, including the Quad Undergraduate Research Scholar Award (Winter & Summer 2024, $10,500), the Jeff Metcalf Grant (Winter & Fall 2023, $3,000), the Data Science Institute Summer Lab Grant (Summer 2023, $6,000), the Advanced Scholars Award (Winter 2025, $5,000), and the Cognitive Science Undergraduate Research Award (Winter 2024, $500). -->


### Startups

I am also actively working on startups. Currently, I’m building Annotaverse, a gamified, crowdsourced AI data annotation platform, as part of [Beta University](https://www.betauniversity.org/) Pre-Accelerator Cohort 6. Another endeavor involved creating AI models that generate personalized ASMR soundtracks, operated within the UChicago-based [International Leadership Council](https://ilc.uchicago.edu/) incubator. 


### Music

I’m deeply interested in indie music and its surrounding subcultures, and I frequently attend live shows. My favorite bands and artists include 脏手指 (Oh! Dirty Fingers), My Bloody Valentine, and ミドリ (Midori). I’ve also written for a music magazine in the past - my pieces include: 

- [Defiant harmony: Shanghai garage punk & Oh! Dirty Fingers’ "Lost Zillionaire."](https://firebirdmagazine.com/music-you-need-to-know/defiantharmony?rq=Dirty) 
- [The shape of dreams: a journey through the history of shoegaze.](https://firebirdmagazine.com/music-history/shoegaze)
