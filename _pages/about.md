Hi there! I am a recent graduate from the University of Chicago, with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. (Honors) in Cognitive Science. 

My **research interests** center on understanding why and how LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities and, at times, undesirable or unsafe behaviors. By applying and developing **mechanistic interpretability** tools, I aim to illuminate the circuits and representations that drive these outcomes and, in turn, develop principled, evidence-based interventions that reshape the modelâ€™s internals. Ultimately, I hope this line of inquiry helps us reflect more deeply on what it means to learn, think, and be human. 

During my undergraduate years at UChicago, I am fortunate to work with [Xuechunzi Bai](https://www.xuechunzibai.com/), [Andrew Lee](https://ajyl.github.io/about),[Chengzhi Mao](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcz/), and [Valentin Hofmann](https://valentinhofmann.github.io/).

I am also an indie music lover, wrote for a music magazine, building startups, and specialized in competition math. You can find more about my life in this [tab](/life/).
